                <p class="text-small">The concept of traditional education has changed radically within the last couple of years. Being physically present in a classroom isn’t the only learning option anymore — not with the rise of the internet and new technologies, at least. Nowadays, you have access to a quality education whenever and wherever you want, as long as you have access to a computer. We are now entering a new era — the revolution of online education.</p>

            A few years ago, the thing that was barely used by any educational institution has become a big part of every student's life today. Since 2020, most universities and schools in India have switched over to online learning for safety reasons.

"I am glad that Orchids- The International School continued their online classes immediately realising the situation." Said Rashmi, a resident of Bengaluru, who lives with her husband and two kids.

"Online school has given me a respite from getting up at 5 am. Now I just have to prepare breakfast for my family. I have more time and energy to focus on my kids and can spend more time with them. I can even help them with their homework, although it is rarely needed since Orchids’ teachers know how to make the students do the homework even in the online classes," she said.

            Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.
